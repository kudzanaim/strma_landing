By signing up or otherwise using the Strma service, websites, and software applications (together, the &ldquo;Strma Service&rdquo; or &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), or accessing any content or material that is made available by Strma through the Service (the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;) you are entering into a binding contract with Strma Media. </span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c0">The Strma Service includes social and interactive features. Use of the Strma Service relies on several technical requirements. Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) and our Privacy Policy. (The Terms, Privacy Policy, and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section, are referred to together as the &ldquo;Agreements&rdquo;.) If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the effective version of the Agreements can be found on Strima&rsquo;s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don&rsquo;t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Strma Service or consume any Content. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Please read the Agreements carefully. They cover important information about Strma Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. The Agreements include information about future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy information, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. </span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c0">Any information that you provided during sign-up can be corrected during the sign-up process by returning to the previous screens and correcting erroneous information. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">In order to use the Strma Service and access the Content, you need to 1. be 18 or older 2. have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">applicable laws 3. promise that any registration information that you submit to Strma is true, accurate, and </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times. </span></p><p class="c91"><span class="c4">2 Changes to the Agreements </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c0">Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we&rsquo;ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us through the customer support contact form. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c4">3 Enjoying Strma </span><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Strima. </span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c3">3.1 Our Services &amp; Paid Subscriptions </span><span class="c0">Strma provides streaming services offering a selection of Zimdancehall music and other genres.
